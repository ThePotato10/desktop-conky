# My Conky

Two conky.conf files I'm using to create my desktop

One (date.conf) creates the clock and date in the top corner, the other (.conkyrc) creates the information widget at the bottom

Also pictured in the screenshot is ![neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch), ![dash to dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/), and ![zafiro-icons](https://github.com/zayronxio/Zafiro-icons)

Note: The network traffic monitor doesn't work on some computers for whatever reason. *sigh*
